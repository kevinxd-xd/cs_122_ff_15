## How to install and run (2 methods)

Start by cloning the repository to the desired path on your system

<div id="install-method-1" />

### Method 1 (Dockerfile)

To install via the Dockerfile, ensure that you have docker installed and running on your machine.

To verify this, open up your terminal and run the following command:

`docker -v`

It should return your docker version number. If you get any sort of error, double-check your docker installation.

In the root of the project directory, the Dockerfile will instruct docker on how to build the image.

To build the image run:

`docker build -t lol-stats:latest .`

This should build the image for us to run. Give it a few moments to finish up.

After the image has been built, you can now run it using docker with the following command:

`docker run -p 5000:5000 lol-stats:latest`

This command specifies the image to run and what ports to map from the container to the outside world. In our case, we
are mapping port 5000 outside, to port 5000 inside the container.

You should now be able to access the web application at:

> http://127.0.0.1:5000

**OR**

> http://localhost:5000

**Note:** If you would like to user the Search via Riot feature, you'll need to generate a development API key from Riot.

### Method 2 (Python Venv)
#### Create a virtual environment
To avoid any conflicts with installed Python libraries on your system, we'll need to create a virtual environment to
avoid these conflicts.

**Tip**: To ensure installation process goes as smoothly as possible, please start in the root of the project directory.

**Steps:**
1. Create a folder called "venv". This is where all of your virtual environment files will go. You can run the command: 
`mkdir venv`
2. After you've made the new folder, navigate into it the folder
`cd  ./venv`
3. Run the command to create the virtual environment
`python -m venv ./`
4. Once properly setup, you can activate your virtual environment via the scripts generated.

To activate (Windows Powershell):
`PATH_TO_YOUR_VENV_FOLDER/Scripts/Activate.ps1`

**WARNING**: You may have execution issues on Windows powershell due to the default execution-policy set. You will need
to change it to run the virtual environment.

To activate (MacOS zsh):
`source /PATH_TO_YOUR_VENV_FOLDER/Scripts/activate`

If you are unable to execute it due to permissions, add the **sudo** command in front of the command.

#### Installing the libraries
Once you have your virtual environment set up, you can begin installing the required libraries.
Navigate to the root of the project where the `requirements.txt` is located. In that directory run the following command.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This command will automatically install all the necessary libraries to run the application

#### Launching the application
After you've installing all the necessary libraries, you are ready to run the app. In the root of the project, try 
running the flask with the following command.
`flask --app app run`

If you are having issues with the command above, try adding `python -m flask` in front.
`python -m flask --app app run`

**Tip**: Some systems may have two versions of Python installed. Running the command with `python` may refer to an
outdated version of Python. In most systems, the most recent Python binary can be called with `python3`.
The resulting new command would be `python3 -m flask --app app run`.

#### Visiting the site
Once the flask server is up and running, you can visit it to verify everything is working. By default, the server should
be listening on port 5000 on localhost.
> http://127.0.0.1:5000

**OR**

> http://localhost:5000

Either of the links should bring you to the homepage.

**Note:** If you would like to user the Search via Riot feature, you'll need to generate a development API key from Riot.
Refer to: [Optional: Add Riot Games API Key](#extension-api-key)

<div id="extension-api-key" />

## Optional (Riot API Search)
If you have access to the Riot Games API, you can generate an API key to use with the Search via Riot API feature.

1. Head to https://developer.riotgames.com/apis
2. Login to your account
3. Go to the dashboard
4. Click on Generate/Regenerate API Key
5. Copy your key
7. Open the `.env` file with your editor of choice
8. Replace '<YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY_HERE>' with the  key you copied.

If you are using the Dockerfile method, you will need to rebuild your image and re-run it after setting the .env file up.

<div id="run-testcases" />

## Running the testcases
Once you are on the homepage, you should see two cards labeled with both of the features. One is "Search via the Riot
API". The other card is labeled "Create analytics using JSON data (Test Case Input)". Use these two features to interact
with the web application and run the testcases.

In the zipped file, there should be a folder named testcases. In this folder, there should be 5 testcases that you can
upload to the web app to create the data analytics. Not all of the five files will work since we added a few to test the
error handling capabilities of our applicaiton. Here is a table of the expected results for each uploaded file.

| Testcase File                           | Expected Results                                                                               |

| testcase_3.json                         | SUCCESS: Displays Fish Kid#NA1‚Äôs player information and graphs                                 |
| testcase_4.json                         | FAILURE: User sees a 400 page due to a non-JSON file submission                                |
| testcase_5.json                         | FAILURE: User sees a 400 page due to incorrect JSON data information that could not be parsed. |
| Search function with no/invalid API Key | FAILURE: User sees a 403 page stating ‚ÄúInvalid API Key‚Äù                                        |

The last testcase does not have a file associated with it. To test this feature, please fill out the
"Search via the Riot API" form and attempt to submit. You should see an error be thrown about there being no valid API
key. This happens because you need a valid API key to access the game server's data. Without the key, you will be unable
to complete the search, throwing an error.
